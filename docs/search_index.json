It’s good practice to clear the environment before starting new work, as it’s best to use fresh up to date data - otherwise we could accidentally use data which has nothing to do with our work. Try clearing and loading in the data again. To clear data we can simply run the following code: rm(list=ls()) We can also manually clear the environment in RStudio by clicking the brush symbol underneath the Environment tab. Sometimes just clearing the Environment tab is not enough - especially if you are working with lots of different packages or other people’s scripts. You should also: Go to Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; General and set “Save .RData on exit” to Never. This does not mean you can’t or shouldn’t save your work in .RData files.

These exercises will show you how R works. We’ll first create an object and call it a, we will give the object a a value of 1. In R the equals = sign tells R to give the object on the left of the sign the value of whatever is on the right of the sign. a = 1 In your environment panel, you should see a appear under the Values section. Now, lets create b and give it a value of 2. b = 2 Lets now add a and b together to create the object c c = a + b #Print the value of c to the Console c # should return the number 3 ## [1] 3 All of R is just an extension of this: applying more complex functions (calculations) across more complex objects. It’s important to appreciate that objects can be more than just single numbers too. They can be entire spreadsheets, which in R are known as data frames. Note that many people use &lt;- instead of =. They mean the same thing in R. = and &lt;- save what is on the right into the name on the left.

["types-of-variables.html", "2.7 Types of variables", " 2.7 Types of variables Like many other types of statistical software, R needs to know what is the variable type of each column. The main types are: 2.7.1 Characters Characters (sometimes referred to as strings or character strings) in R are letters, words, or even whole sentences (an example of this may be free text comments). We can specify these using the as.character() function. Characters are displayed in-between &quot;&quot; (or ''). 2.7.2 Factors Factors are fussy characters. Factors are fussy because they have something called levels. Levels are all the unique values this variable could take - e.g. like when we looked at mydata$cause %&gt;% unique(). Using factors rather than just characters can be useful because: The values factor levels can take is fixed. For example, if the levels of your column called sex are “Male” and “Female” and you try to add a new patient where sex is called just “F” you will get a warning from R. If sex was a character column rather than a factor R would have no problem with this and you would end up with “Male”, “Female”, and “F” in your your column. Levels have an order. When we plotted the different causes of death in the last session, R ordered them alphabetically (because cause was a character rather than a factor). But if you want to use a non-alphabetical order, e.g. “Communicable diseases”-“Non-communicable diseases”-“Injuries”, we need make cause into a factor. Making a character column into a factor enables us to define and change the order of the levels. Furthermore, there are useful tools such as fct_inorder or fct_infreq that can order factor levels for us. These can be huge benefits, especially as a lot of medical data analyses include comparing different risks to a reference level. Nevertheless, the fussiness of factors can sometimes be unhelpful or even frustrating. For example, if you really did want to add a new level to your gender column (e.g., “Prefer not to say”) you will either have to convert the column to a character, add it, and convert it back to a factor, or use fct_expand to add the level and then add your new line. 2.7.2.1 Exercise Temporarily type fct_inorder anywhere in your script, then press F1. Read the Description in the Help tab and discuss with your neighbour how fct_inorder and fct_infreq would order your factor levels. 2.7.3 Numbers Self-explanatory! These are numbers. In R, we specify these using the as.numeric() function. Numbers without decimal places are sometimes called integers. Click on the blue arrow in front of mydata in the Environment tab and see that year is an int whereas deaths is a num. 2.7.4 Specifying variable types as.character(mydata$cause) as.numeric(mydata$year) factor(mydata$year) #Lets save the cause as a factor mydata$cause = factor(mydata$cause) #Now lets print it out mydata$cause 2.7.5 Exercise Change the order of the levels in mydata$cause so that “Non-communicable diseases” come before “Injuries”. Hint: use F1 to investigate examples of how fct_relevel() works. "],
["importing-data.html", "2.8 Importing data", " 2.8 Importing data For historical reasons, R’s default functions (e.g. read.csv() or data.frame()) convert all characters to factors automatically (for more on this see forcats.tidyverse.org. But it is usually more convenient to deal with characters and convert some of the columns to factors when necessary. Base R: mydata = read.csv(&quot;global_burden_disease_short.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) The tidyverse version, read_csv(), has stringsAsFactors set to FALSE by default (and it is a lot faster than read.csv() when reading in large datasets). Tidyverse: mydata = read_csv(&quot;global_burden_disease_short.csv&quot;) ## Parsed with column specification: ## cols( ## cause = col_character(), ## year = col_integer(), ## deaths = col_double() ## ) You can use the “Import Dataset” button in the Environment tab to get the code for importing data from Excel, SPSS, SAS, or Stata.

["adding-columns-to-dataframes.html", "2.9 Adding columns to dataframes", " 2.9 Adding columns to dataframes If we wanted to add in a new column or variable to our data, we can simply can use the dollar sign ‘$’ to create a new variable inside a pre-existing piece of data: mydata$new = 1 mydata$new2 = 1:18 Run these lines and click on mydata in the Environment tab to check this worked as expected. Conversely, if we want to delete a specific variable or column we can use the ‘NULL’ function, or alternatively ask R to select() the data without the new variable included. mydata$new = NULL mydata = mydata %&gt;% select(-new2) We can make new variables using calculations based on variables in the data too. The mutate function is useful here. All you have to specify within the mutate function is the name of the variable (this can be new or pre-existing) and where the new data should come from. There are two equivalent ways of defining new columns based on a calculation with a previous column: #First option mydata$years_from_1990 = mydata$year - 1990 mydata$deaths_millions = mydata$deaths/1000000 #Second option (mutate() function) mydata = mydata %&gt;% mutate(years_from_1990 = year-1990, deaths_millions = deaths/1000000) Throughout this course we will be using both of these ways to create or modify columns.

It retains information about your groupings and calculations are applied on each group separately. To go back to summarising the whole dataset again use ungroup(). Note that summarise() is different to the summary() function we used in Session 2.

["multiple-linear-regression.html", "7.5 Multiple linear regression", " 7.5 Multiple linear regression Multiple linear regression includes more than one predictor variable. There are a few ways to include more variables, depending on whether they should share the intercept and how they interact: Simple linear regression (exactly one predictor variable): myfit = lm(lifeExp~year, data=eurodata) Multiple linear regression (additive): myfit = lm(lifeExp~year+country, data=eurodata) Multiple linear regression (all interactions): myfit = lm(lifeExp~year*country, data=eurodata) Multiple linear regression (some interactions): myfit = lm(lifeExp~year:country, data=eurodata) These examples of multiple regression include two variables: year and country, but we could include more by just adding them with +. 7.5.1 Exercise Open the second Shiny app (“Multiple regression”) and see how: In simple regression, there is only one intercept and slope for the whole dataset. Using the additive model (lm(formula = y ~ x + group) the two lines (one for each group) have different intercepts but the same slope. However, the lm() summary seems to only include one line called “(Intercept)”, how to find the intercept for the second group of points? Using the interactive model (lm(formula = y ~ x*group)) the two lines have different intercepts and different slopes. 7.5.2 Exercise Convince yourself that using an fully interactive multivariable model is the same as running several separate simple linear regression models. Remember that we calculate the life expectancy in 1952 (intercept) and improvement per year (slope) for Turkey and the United Kingdom: fit_uk %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 2)) %&gt;% select(term, estimate) ## term estimate ## 1 (Intercept) 68.81 ## 2 year_from1952 0.19 fit_turkey %&gt;% tidy() %&gt;% mutate(estimate = round(estimate, 2)) %&gt;% select(term, estimate) ## term estimate ## 1 (Intercept) 46.02 ## 2 year_from1952 0.50 (The lines tidy(), mutate(), and select() are only included for neater presentation here, you can use summary() instead.)

["what-is-logistic-regression.html", "9.1 What is Logistic Regression?", " 9.1 What is Logistic Regression? As we have seen in previous sessions, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships between variables. For instance, we may try to predict the blood pressure of a group of patients based on their age. As age and blood pressure are on a continuous scale, this is an example of linear regression. Logistic regression is an extension of this, where the variable being predicted is categorical. We will deal with binary logistic regression, where the variable being predicted has two levels, e.g. yes or no, 0 or 1. In healthcare this is usually done for an event (like death) occurring or not occurring. Logistic regression can tell us the probability of the outcome occuring. The aims of this session are to: Take you through Logistic Regression in R Learn how to fit a multivariable logistic regression model Output a logistic regression model to useful statistics Logistic regression lets you adjust for the effects of confounding factors on an outcome. When you read a paper that says it has adjusted for confounding factors, this is the usual method which is used. Adjusting for confounding factors allows us to isolate the true effect of a variable upon an outcome. For example, if we wanted to know the effects of smoking on deaths from heart attacks, we would need to also control for things like sex and diabetes, as we know they contribute towards heart attacks too. Although in binary logistic regression the outcome must have two levels, the predictor variables (also known as the explanatory variables) can be either continuous or categorical. Logistic regression can be performed to examine the influence of one predictor variable, which is known as a univariable analysis. Or multiple predictor variables, known as a multivariable analysis.

["definitions.html", "9.2 Definitions", " 9.2 Definitions Dependent variable (in clinical research usually synonymous to outcome) - is what we are trying to explain, i.e. we are trying to identify the factors associated with a particular outcome. In binomial logistic regression, the dependent variable has exactly two levels (e.g. “Died” or “Alive”, “Yes - Complications” or “No Complications”, “Cured” or “Not Cured”, etc.). Explanatory variables (also known as predictors, confounding variables, or “adjusted for”) - patient-level information, usually including demographics (age, gender) as well as clinical information (disease stage, tumour type). Explanatory variables can be categorical as well as continuous, and categorical variables can have more than two levels. Univariable - analysis with only one Explanatory variable. Multivariable - analysis with more than one Explanatory variable. Synonymous to “adjusted”. (Multivariate - technically means more than one Dependent variable (we will not discuss this type of analysis), but very often used interchangeably with Multivariable.) "],
["odds-and-probabilities.html", "9.3 Odds and probabilities", " 9.3 Odds and probabilities Odds and probabilities can get confusing so let’s get them straight: Odds and probabilities can always be interconverted. For example, if the odds of a patient dying from a disease are 9 to 1 then the probability of death (also known as risk) is 10%. Odds of 1 to 1 equal 50%. \\(Odds = \\frac{p}{1-p}\\), where \\(p\\) is the probability of the outcome occuring (or the circle being red). Look at the numbers and convince yourself that this works. 9.3.1 Odds ratios For a given categorical explanatory variable (e.g. gender), the likelihood of an outcome/dependent occuring (e.g cancer) can be expressed in a ratio of odds or odds ratio , e.g. the odds of men developing cancer is 2-times that of females, odds ratio = 2.0. An alternative is a ratio of probabilites, called a risk ratio or relative risk. Odds ratios have useful mathematical characteristics and are the main expression of results in logistic regression analysis. "],
["melanoma-dataset.html", "9.4 Melanoma dataset", " 9.4 Melanoma dataset Malignant Melanoma is a cancer of the skin. It is agressive and highly invasive, making it difficult to treat. It’s classically divided into 4 stages of severity, based upon the depth of the tumour: Stage I- &lt;0.5 mm depth Stage II- 0.5 to 1.0 mm depth Stage III- 1.0 to 4.0 mm depth Stage IV- &gt; 4.0 mm depth This will be important in our analysis as we will creating a new variable based upon this. Using logistic regression, we will investigate factors associated with death from malignant melanoma. 9.4.1 Doing logistic regression in R There are a few different ways of creating a logistic regression in R. The glm() function is probably the most common and most flexible one to use. (glm stands for generalised linear model.) Within the glm() function there are several options in the function we must define to make R run a logistic regression. data - you must define the dataframe to be used in the regression. family - this tells R to treat the analysis as a logisitic regression. For our purposes, family will always be &quot;binomial&quot; (as binary data follow this distribution). x ~ a + b + c - this is the formula for the logistic regression, with x being the outcome and a, b and c being predictor variables. Note the outcome is separated from the rest of the formula and sits on the left hand side of a ~. The confounding variables are on the right side, separated by a + sign.

But this doesn’t mean a lot to humans reading a paper- or us in fact. The estimate output of summary(model_1) represents the logarithm of the odds ratio.

The exp() function will do this. exp(model1$coefficients) ## (Intercept) sex.factorMale ## 0.3846154 2.1767442 This gives us an odds ratio of 2.03 for males. That is to say, males are twice as likely to die from melanoma than females. Now a confidence interval might be handy.

In this circumstance the patient is considered ‘censored’. survival_object = Surv(mydata$time, mydata$status.factor == &quot;Died&quot;) # It is often useful to convert days into years survival_object = Surv(mydata$time/365, mydata$status.factor == &quot;Died&quot;) # Investigate this: head(survival_object) # + marks censoring in this case &quot;Died of other causes&quot; # Or that the follow-up ended and the patient is censored. ## [1] 0.02739726+ 0.08219178+ 0.09589041+ 0.27123288+ 0.50684932 0.55890411 10.2.1 KM analysis for whole cohort 10.2.2 Model The survival object is the first step to performing univariable and multivariable survival analyses. A univariable model can then be fitted. If you want to plot survival stratified by a single grouping variable, you can substitute “survival_object ~ 1” by “survival_object ~ factor” # For all patients my_survfit = survfit(survival_object ~ 1, data = mydata) my_survfit # 205 patients, 57 events ## Call: survfit(formula = survival_object ~ 1, data = mydata) ## ## n events median 0.95LCL 0.95UCL ## 205 57 NA NA NA 10.2.3 Life table A life table is the tabular form of a KM plot, which you may be familiar with. It shows survival as a proportion, together with confidence limits. # The whole table is shown with, summary(my_survfit) # Here is summary(my_survfit, times=c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) ## Call: survfit(formula = survival_object ~ 1, data = mydata) ## ## time n.risk n.event survival std.err lower 95% CI upper 95% CI ## 0 205 0 1.000 0.0000 1.000 1.000 ## 1 193 6 0.970 0.0120 0.947 0.994 ## 2 183 9 0.925 0.0187 0.889 0.962 ## 3 167 15 0.849 0.0255 0.800 0.900 ## 4 160 6 0.818 0.0274 0.766 0.874 ## 5 122 9 0.769 0.0303 0.712 0.831 # 5 year survival is 77% # Help is at hand help(summary.survfit) 10.2.4 KM plot A KM plot can easily be generated using the survminer package. For more information on how the survminer package draws this plot, or how to modify it: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/survminer-r-package-survival-data-analysis-and-visualization and https://github.com/kassambara/survminer library(survminer) my_survplot = ggsurvplot(my_survfit, data = mydata, risk.table = TRUE, ggtheme = theme_bw(), palette = &#39;Dark2&#39;, conf.int = TRUE, pval=TRUE) ## Warning in .pvalue(fit, data = data, method = method, pval = pval, pval.coord = pval.coord, : There are no survival curves to be compared. ## This is a null model. my_survplot # Note can also take `ggplot()` options. my_survplot$plot + annotate(&#39;text&#39;, x = 5, y = 0.25, label=&#39;Whole cohort&#39;) Here is an alternative plot in base R to compare. Not only does this produce a more basic survival plot, but tailoring the plot can be more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, appending a life table (“risk.table”) alongside the plot can also be difficult (yet this is often required for interpretation / publication). plot(my_survfit, mark.time=FALSE, conf.int=TRUE, xlab=&quot;Time (years)&quot;, ylab=&quot;Survival&quot;) 10.2.5 Exercise Using the above scripts, perform a univariable Kaplam Meier analysis to determine if ulcer.factor influences overall survival. Hint: survival_object ~ ulcer.factor. Try modifying the plot produced (see Help for ggsurvplot). For example: Add in a medial survival lines: surv.median.line=&quot;hv&quot; Alter the plot legend: legend.title = &quot;Ulcer Present&quot;, legend.labs = c(&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;) Change the y-axis to a percentage: ylab = &quot;Probability of survival (%)&quot;, surv.scale = &quot;percent&quot; Display follow-up up to 10 years, and change the scale to 1 year: xlim = c(0,10), break.time.by = 1) 10.2.6 Log-rank test Two KM survival curves can be compared using the log-rank test. Note survival curves can also be compared using a Wilcoxon test that may be appropriate in some circumstances. This can easily be performed in library(survival) using the function survdiff(). survdiff(survival_object ~ ulcer.factor, data = mydata) ## Call: ## survdiff(formula = survival_object ~ ulcer.factor, data = mydata) ## ## N Observed Expected (O-E)^2/E (O-E)^2/V ## ulcer.factor=Absent 115 16 35.8 10.9 29.6 ## ulcer.factor=Present 90 41 21.2 18.5 29.6 ## ## Chisq= 29.6 on 1 degrees of freedom, p= 5.41e-08 Is there a signficiant difference between survival curves?

["dates-in-r.html", "10.4 Dates in R", " 10.4 Dates in R 10.4.1 Converting dates to survival time In the melanoma example dataset, we already had the time in a convenient format for survial analysis - survival time in days since the operation. This section shows how to convert dates into “days from event”. First we will generate a dummy operation date and censoring date based on the melanoma data. library(lubridate) first_date = ymd(&quot;1966-01-01&quot;) # let&#39;s create made-up dates for the operations last_date = first_date + days(nrow(mydata)-1) # assume tone every day from 1-Jan 1966 operation_date = seq(from = first_date, to = last_date, by = &quot;1 day&quot;) # create dates mydata$operation_date = operation_date # add the created sequence to melanoma dataset Now we will to create a ‘censoring’ date by adding time from the melanoma dataset to our made up operation date. Remember the censoring date is either when an event occurred (e.g. death) or the last known alive status of the patient. mydata %&gt;% mutate(censoring_date = operation_date + days(time)) -&gt; mydata # (Same as doing:): mydata$censoring_date = mydata$operation_date + days(mydata$time) Now consider if we only had the operation date and censoring date. We want to create the time variable. mydata %&gt;% mutate(time_days = censoring_date - operation_date) -&gt; mydata The Surv() function expects a number (numeric variable), rather than a date object, so we’ll convert it: # Surv(mydata$time_days, mydata$status==1) # this doesn&#39;t work mydata %&gt;% mutate(time_days_numeric = as.numeric(time_days)) -&gt; mydata survival_object = Surv(mydata$time_days_numeric, mydata$status==1) # this works as expected "],
