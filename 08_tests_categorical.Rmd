# Tests for categorical variables

## Data
We are now changing to a new dataset, `melanoma`. 
Click on `mydata` in your environment and have a look at the values - you'll see that categorical variables are coded as numbers, rather than text. 
You will need to recode these numbers into proper factors. 

```{r, message = F}

library(tidyverse)
library(finalfit)
library(broom)
mydata = boot::melanoma

```

### Recap on factors

Press `F1` on `boot::melanoma` to see its description. 
Use the information from help to change the numbers into proper factors (e.g. 0 - female, 1 - male).

<!-- Dollars here which is quite late on, we should change this. Agree.  -->

```{r}

mydata$status %>% 
  factor() %>% 
  fct_recode("Died"  = "1",
             "Alive" = "2",
             "Died - other causes" = "3") %>% 
  fct_relevel("Alive") -> # move Alive to front (first factor level) 
  mydata$status.factor    # so odds ratio will be relative to that

mydata$sex %>% 
  factor() %>% 
  fct_recode("Female" = "0",
             "Male" = "1") ->
  mydata$sex.factor
  
mydata$ulcer %>% 
  factor() %>% 
  fct_recode("Present" = "1",
             "Absent"  = "0") -> 
  mydata$ulcer.factor

#the cut() function makes a continuous variable into a categorical variable
mydata$age %>% 
  cut(breaks = c(4,20,40,60,95), include.lowest=TRUE) ->
  mydata$age.factor

```


## Chi-squared test / Fisher's exact test

### Plotting

Always plot new data first!

```{r, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}

mydata %>% 
	ggplot(aes(x = ulcer.factor, fill=status.factor)) + 
	  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
	  theme_bw() +
	  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")

```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}

mydata %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age.factor, fill = status.factor)) +
    geom_bar() +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired")

```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}

mydata %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ulcer.factor, fill=status.factor)) + 
    geom_bar() +
    theme_bw() +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
    facet_grid(sex.factor~age.factor)

```

## Analysis

### Using base R

First lets group together those that 'died of another cause' with those 'alive', to give a disease-specific mortality variable (`fct_collapse()` will help us). 

```{r}

mydata$status.factor %>%  
	fct_collapse("Alive" = c("Alive", "Died - other causes")) ->
  mydata$status.factor

```

Let's test mortality against sex.

```{r}

table(mydata$status.factor, mydata$sex.factor)
chisq.test(mydata$status.factor, mydata$sex.factor)

```

Note that `chisq.test()` defaults to the Yates' continuity correction. 

<!-- Lots of dollars here -->
It is fine to use this, but if you have a particular need not to, turn if off with `chisq.test(mydata$status.factor, mydata$sex.factor, correct=FALSE)`.

<!-- Crosstable in? -->
### Using `CrossTable`
This gives lots of useful information. 
It is readable in R and has lots of options, including Fisher's exact test. 
It is not that easy to extract results. 
\newpage
```{r}

library(gmodels)
# F1 CrossTable to see options
CrossTable(mydata$status.factor, mydata$sex.factor, chisq=TRUE)

```

### Exercise
Use the 3 methods (`table`, `chisq.test`, `CrossTable`) to test `status.factor` against `ulcer.factor`. 

```{r, eval=F}

table(mydata$status.factor, mydata$ulcer.factor)
chisq.test(mydata$status.factor, mydata$ulcer.factor)

```

Using `CrossTable`
```{r, eval=F}

CrossTable(mydata$status.factor, mydata$ulcer.factor, chisq=TRUE)

```

### Fisher's exact test

An assumption of the chi-squared test is that the 'expected cell count' is greater than 5. 
If it is less than 5 the test becomes unreliable and the Fisher's exact test is recommended. 

Run the following code. 

```{r}

library(gmodels)
CrossTable(mydata$status.factor, mydata$age.factor, expected=TRUE, chisq=TRUE)

```

Why does it give a warning? Run it a second time including `fisher=TRUE`. 


```{r}

library(gmodels)
CrossTable(mydata$status.factor, mydata$age.factor, expected=TRUE, chisq=TRUE)

```


## Summarising multiple factors (optional)
`CrossTable` is useful for summarising single variables. 
We often want to summarise more than one factor or continuous variable against our `dependent` variable of interest. 
Think of Table 1 in a journal article. 

## Summarising factors with `library(finalfit)`

This is our own package which we have written and maintain. 
It contains functions to summarise data for publication tables and figures, and to easily run regression analyses. 
We specify a `dependent` or outcome variable, and a set of `explanatory` or predictor varaibles. 

```{r, message = FALSE}

library(finalfit)
mydata %>% 
  summary_factorlist(dependent = "status.factor", 
                     explanatory = c("sex.factor", "ulcer.factor", "age.factor"),
                     p = TRUE,
                     column = TRUE)

```


### Summarising factors with `library(tidyverse)`

### Example

`Tidyverse` gives the flexibility and power to examine millions of rows of your data any way you wish. The following are intended as an extension to what you have already done. These demonstrate some more advanced approaches to combining `tidy` functions. 


```{r}

# Calculate number of patients in each group
counted_data = mydata %>%
  count(ulcer.factor, status.factor)

# Add the total number of people in each status group
counted_data2  = counted_data %>%
  group_by(status.factor) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n))

```

```{r}

# Calculate the percentage of n to total
counted_data3 = counted_data2 %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100*n/total, 1))

```

Create a combined columns of both `n` and `percentage` using `paste()` to add brackets around the percentage.

```{r}

counted_data4  = counted_data3 %>% 
  mutate(count_perc = paste0(n, " (", percentage, ")"))

```

Or combine everything together without the intermediate `counted_data` breaks.

```{r}

mydata %>%
  count(ulcer.factor, status.factor) %>%
  group_by(status.factor) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100*n/total, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(count_perc = paste0(n, " (", percentage, ")")) %>% 
  select(-total, -n, -percentage) %>% 
  spread(status.factor, count_perc)

```

### Exercise

By changing one and only one word at a time in the above block (the "Combine everything together" section)

Reproduce this:

```{r, echo=F}

# Age
mydata %>%
  count(age.factor, status.factor) %>%
  group_by(status.factor) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100*n/total, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(count_perc = paste0(n, " (", percentage, ")")) %>% 
  select(-total, -n, -percentage) %>% 
  spread(status.factor, count_perc) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

```

And then this:
```{r, echo=F}

# Sex
mydata %>%
  count(sex.factor, status.factor) %>%
  group_by(status.factor) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(n)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(100*n/total, 1)) %>% 
  mutate(count_perc = paste0(n, " (", percentage, ")")) %>% 
  select(-total, -n, -percentage) %>% 
  spread(status.factor, count_perc) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

```

Solution: The only thing you need to change is the first variable in `count()`, e.g., `count(age.factor, ...`.
